# Car Chargers :car: :zap:

This app displays a map of all the electric car charging stations in the UK.

Data is provided by Data.GOV, specifically the [National Charge Point Registry](https://data.gov.uk/dataset/1ce239a6-d720-4305-ab52-17793fedfac3/national-charge-point-registry). Charge locations are displayed on a map, clustered in areas with multiple charge points. Clicking a cluster will zoom the map to its location. Clicking a single map marker will display details of that charging location:

- the name
- street address and postcode
- whether or not the location can be accessed 24 hours
- payment details for the charging location
- types of connector available at the location

The data on the map can be filtered:

- by 24 hour access
- by physical access restrictions
- by subscription requirement
- by available connector types

This app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and uses the built in Webpack Dev Server to run locally.
